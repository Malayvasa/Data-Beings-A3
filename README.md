## Concept Note
Our piece, in the medium of a website, presents the user with an interactive visualization and bifurcation of genres. Here the narrative drives us forward and brings impactful connection to the gender discourse. Having begun the conversation we afford the user a moment to explore genres through a lens of genders interactively by displaying a 2D colour spectrum that responds to your cursor's position to display genres for the user at their own discretion to draw differences and parallels. At the end of this exploration we leave the user with an insight of the french counterpart of the word “genre” (i.e gender) and perhaps leave them with more questions than we have posed.

By using parallels between musical genres and gender, this project aims to normalize the notion that every human lies on a spectrum, whether in terms of their sexuality or their gender, mood or preference. Set compartments and expected behaviors are a myth, and can be pointed out to be the cause behind a great many social problems today. Just as musical genres are diverse and defy categorization when looked at closely, so does gender, a concept much more complex than the binary or even “trinary” ideals that we have been taught. Through the narrative of music, we wish to introduce and discuss these ideas in an unique, approachable, and sensational way. Our intention is to alter mindsets by taking users through this journey.
